The Quick Launcher software streamlines the process of launching applications, opening folders, and accessing files efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface with customizable buttons linked to specific applications, folders, or files, enabling users to organize and access their frequently used resources easily. It offers features for setting desktop icons and allows personalization through user-configurable JSON files.

This software was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT. Additionally, I must express my gratitude to the open-source community for providing various guides and tutorials, enabling me to develop a satisfying application from scratch.

There are two versions: electron and python.

Electron version: more beautiful, however slower.

Python version: fast, however not so beautiful.
